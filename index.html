                This is my first Unity game project on my own! The idea originally came to fruition during the GMTK Game Jam 2023. I hope to put my game design theory and programming experience to test!

                I have always loved arcade racing games. I played CTR on the PS1 when I was younger, and Mario Kart Wii CTGP-R during high school. I’ve recently discovered the stylish Ridge Racer Type 4 and am having a blast. RRT4 is the base inspiration for this game’s gameplay, music, and visuals.

Win the race- or even better, chase a high score! Push your tricking skill to the limit when Trick Tracks comes out &lt;TBD&gt;!!</em>

              <p>
                In beading video game sprites, I found it quite difficult to keep track of the colors I used throughout a sprite, and their respective places. During Spring break of 2021 I looked around but was unsatisfied with other "picture to bead sprite" converters and managers online. So, I wanted to use my new Java skills I learned from class. I was using Google Sheets to keep track of my bead colors, so I decided to write a Java program that would work with Google Sheets Apps Script that did all the tedious work for me.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In fuse beading video game sprites, I found it pretty hard to keep track of all the colors and positions- especially when beading images with as much variation in color as sprites. The goal for this project was to fill this need, so I can make more perler designs faster. I applied programming concepts I learned from class for the Java backend. I used Google Sheets to organize my beads already, so I made an extension with Apps Script.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                <em>
                This is really just a project for learning, since the codebase is pretty amateurish and only uses the Spring framework's embedded Tomcat server for deployment onto the Google Cloud platform. After I become more acclimated to standard web app practices at my university, I hope to do a full rewrite of this program later- as well as release it to the public, for others to use!

                This is a game capstone project I worked on with my group of 5. It was my first exposure to Unity and I learned a lot about the whole process of making a game. I remember it being very fun, because it was the first time I got to be creative in a CS course. I developed a procedurally generated level system and made an Instagram page. See the devlog below!

                Had an old Optiplex and some drives laying around. Figured I'd attempt what I always wanted to do: my own home file server. This jank setup sports a 2TB and 1TB mirror, in a nice and compact sff optiplex. I get decent speeds since it's connected to ethernet via MOCA adapter (thanks to my younger brother). I also have an always-on Raspberry Pi setup as a Wake on Lan server, to wake the NAS and my home pc. Super ghetto, but it works. And yeah I plan to upgrade the cardboard

                This was a short game I created after the release of Nintendo's Game Builder Garage. It was fun learning a new "toy" engine- GBG is pretty capable when you want to create fun, simple projects or prototypes. I love the integration with the Switch's hardware, essentially creating this 'sandbox' where you can mess around with the various sensors the JoyCon gives you.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The thing I disliked about it was, truthfully, how limiting it was. This game takes up the entire Nodon (the fun "code blocks" you use to program your games) limit, which is 512. Imagine, you have to keep track of game state, level progression, user input, environment, and of course, game logic, under this limit. I found myself trying too hard to just make things work; sometimes I'd rather just use Unity.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In the end, GBG is still a game, about making games. In Japan, it seems to be advertised for kids who want to get their feet wet in coding- NOT for people wanting to make a 3d metroidvania. Despite this, I had fun nonetheless. The community is still very much alive, with a creator named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VideoDojoPro"> VideoDojo</a> and the <a href="https://discord.gg/game-builder-garage-840744760431870003"></a> GBG Discord. People there smarter than me really push the engine to its limits.

                This is my first GBG game. I had a lot of ideas that I ultimately had to strip down due to messy code + nodon limit :( regardless, thanks for playing!

              <p>I started beading around 2013 (?) after me and my brother got an interesting "melty beads" kit at Walmart one day. Took a long break until the 2020 Covid quarantine, when I realized that I could bring my favorite characters to life from my favorite game at the time, Octopath Traveler. I made some coffee paper and framed them up, and they proudly hang on my wall today. I continue to make more mini Perler projects occasionally, while lately I've been working on some software in Java and Google Sheets Apps Script to help me organize my bead projects.
