                    I have always loved arcade racing games. I played CTR on the PS1 when I was younger, and Mario Kart Wii CTGP-R during high school. I’ve recently discovered the stylish Ridge Racer Type 4 and am having a blast. RRT4 is the base inspiration for this game’s gameplay, music, and visuals.

                    Ideated from my fuse bead hobby, "choosing colors is the hardest part!!" I needed a way to go from video game sprites to fuse beads easily. I had just finished my intro programming course at my university, determined to create this tool, for myself, and others.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    I was already keeping track of my beads in Google Sheets, so I learned about Google Apps Script to make an extension! It was pretty handy- the end result is at the end of this page.
                  </p>
                  <!-- <p>
                    In beading video game sprites, I found it quite difficult to keep track of the colors I used throughout a sprite, and their respective places. During Spring break of 2021 I looked around but was unsatisfied with other "picture to bead sprite" converters and managers online. So, I wanted to use my new Java skills I learned from class. I was using Google Sheets to keep track of my bead colors, so I decided to write a Java program that would work with Google Sheets Apps Script that did all the tedious work for me.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In fuse beading video game sprites, I found it pretty hard to keep track of all the colors and positions- especially when beading images with as much variation in color as sprites. The goal for this project was to fill this need, so I can make more perler designs faster. I applied programming concepts I learned from class for the Java backend. I used Google Sheets to organize my beads already, so I made an extension with Apps Script.
                  </p> -->
                  <br>

                    <em>
                    This is really just a project for learning, since the codebase is pretty amateurish and only uses the Spring framework's embedded Tomcat server for deployment onto the Google Cloud platform. After I become more acclimated to standard web app practices at my university, I hope to do a full rewrite of this program later- as well as release it to the public, for others to use! (planning on Summer 2024)

            <p>Salmon Saviors is an immersive game designed to simulate the challenges salmon face during their journey back to their spawning grounds.</p> 
            
            <p>
              
              Up to three players use different peripherals to help salmon to their spawn: 
              <li>
                The scrub brush removes water pollution that harms the fish. It can also be used to clean pollution off the fish, preventing loss of salmon.
              </li>
              <li>
                The hammer is used to build fish ladders, guiding fish over dams that obstruct their migration. hit the hammer where you want to place the fish ladder.
              </li>
              <li>
                The salmon controller uses the joystick to move a school of fish across the screen. LED lights on the controller indicate how many salmon are still alive.
              </li>
              Please see the Design Process PDF below for more pictures!
            </p>
              
            <p>The game aims to educate players while promoting environmental stewardship and conservation efforts for salmon habitats.</p>
