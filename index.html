                This is my first Unity game project on my own! The idea originally came to fruition during the GMTK Game Jam 2023. I hope to put my game design theory and programming experience to test!

                I have always loved arcade racing games. I played CTR on the PS1 when I was younger, and Mario Kart Wii CTGP-R during high school. I’ve recently discovered the stylish Ridge Racer Type 4 and am having a blast. RRT4 is the base inspiration for this game’s gameplay, music, and visuals.

                <em>Trick Tracks is an action puzzle racing game where YOU control the track! Place blocks on the track to jump, trick, and grind your way past competition. Win the race- or even better, chase a high score! Push your tricking skill to the limit when Trick Tracks comes out &lt;TBD&gt;!!</em>

                During my first hours of beading video game sprites, I found it was a horribly troublesome task of keeping track of the colors that I used throughout a sprite, and their respective places. During Spring break of 2021 I looked around but was unsatisfied with other "picture to bead sprite" converters and managers online. So, I wanted to use my new Java skills I learned from class. I was using Google Sheets to keep track of my bead colors, so I decided to write a Java program that would work with Google Sheets Apps Script that did all the tedious work for me.

                This is a game capstone project I worked on with my group of 5. It was my first exposure to Unity and I learned a lot about the whole process of making a game. I remember it being very fun, because it was the first time I got to be creative in a CS course. I developed a procedurally generated level system and made an Instagram page. See the devlog below!

              <p>I started beading around 2013 (?) after me and my brother got an interesting "melty beads" kit at Walmart one day. Took a long break until the 2020 Covid quarantine, when I realized that I could bring my favorite characters to life from my favorite game at the time, Octopath Traveler. I made some coffee paper and framed them up, and they proudly hang on my wall today. I continue to make more mini Perler projects occasionally, while lately I've been working on some software in Java and Google Sheets Apps Script to help me organize my bead projects.
